👋 Hi! I'm Cauã Pereira, a Computer Science student at Unoeste and a scientific researcher in the field of virtual reality. Currently in my fourth semester, my academic and professional journey is marked by practical projects and involvement in various areas of technology.

💻 In addition to my studies, I work as a freelancer, developing tech solutions. My career started at the age of 16 at SENAI in Presidente Prudente, where I assisted teachers and students in the electrical field. In 2024, I worked as a teaching assistant at Unoeste, where I taught introductory IT courses and workshops, with a focus on logic and data structures. I also provided daily support to students, helping them with algorithm and programming-related queries.

🛠️ My core skills include problem-solving and algorithm development. I have experience in languages such as C, Python, Java, and JavaScript, along with knowledge in data science, competitive programming, Node, React, and SQL. My technical background includes 16 courses at SENAI, as well as specialization in electronics.

🌍 Fluent in both English and Brazilian Portuguese, I’m always open to new opportunities and challenges in the tech world.
